# Project Images

Place your project screenshots and related images in this folder.

## Organization

- Use descriptive filenames that match your project names
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios for better presentation
- Recommended size: 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- Optimize images for web (WebP format recommended)

## Usage

These images are referenced in:

- `src/data/projects.ts` - Main project data
- Individual project pages in `src/pages/projects/`

When adding new project images:

1. Add the optimized image to this folder
2. Update the project data with the correct path
3. Ensure alt text is descriptive for accessibility
